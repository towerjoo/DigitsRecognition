# DigitsRecognition

Goal: able to recognize any length of digits combination.(all digits come from MNIST dataset)

* the length is in [5, 20] (but we can change this as we want)
* each digit will be applied with [0.5, 1.0) resizing, and [0, 90] degree rotation
	

A sample is like this:

which is: `3463700204839487`
